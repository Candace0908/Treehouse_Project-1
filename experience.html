      <p>What we hope to accomplish with our work is to be able to extend beyond just software but an overall approach towards women in technology careers, business and life.</P>
      <p>It's not a secret that techology is everywhere and the hope for this website is to become a part of all the aspects to include women.</P>
      <h2>To get things started:</h2>
      <p>First bring awareness to our services</P>
      <p>Break into new areas of technology</p>
      <p>Discover new talent</p>
      <h3>Come together with other women in tech in all parts of the world:</h3>
